This is a calculator I built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. 

It has keyboard support.

I ran into some issues during developing this, mainly ones related to the 
mathmatics. Values beyond a certain range would not respond properly to calculations
(that is, they would be slightly wrong).

To fix this, I have made the calculator throw an error if the value is too high 
or attempting to be precise beyond what the calculator can handle.
